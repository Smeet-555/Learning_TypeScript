Type Annotations & Type Inference in TypeScript

What are Type Annotations?
  Type Annotation means explicitly telling TypeScript what type a variable, function parameter, or return type should have.

Syntax: 
  let variableName: type = value;


Why use Type Annotations?
  | Without Annotation | With Annotation          |
  | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
  | Error-prone        | Safe & predictable       |
  | Misuse possible    | Prevents wrong usage     |
  | Large apps harder  | Contract between modules |

  
What is Type Inference?
  Type inference means TypeScript automatically detects types based on the assigned value.
  So you don’t need to annotate every time.

Example:
  let city = "Mumbai"; // inferred as string
  let count = 10;      // inferred as number  
  city = 123; // ❌ Error: number is not assignable to type string
