Learned how typescript works internally

      TypeScript code (.ts)
                  |
                  |  Type checking + Parsing + Conversion
                  V
       JavaScript code (.js)
                  |
                  V
       Browser or Node.js executes

WHAT TYPESCRIPT ACTUALLY DOES

| Task           | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Type Checking  | Ensures variables & functions use correct types |
| Compilation    | Converts TypeScript → JavaScript                |
| Removes Types  | No type is present in runtime JS                |
| Reports Errors | Helps developer catch issues early              |
| Uses Config    | Controlled through `tsconfig.json`              |

SOME OF THE KEY CONCEPTS
| Concept                         | Description                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Static Type Checking            | Before running code, errors appear   |
| Transpilation                   | Converting TypeScript → JS           |
| Erasing Types                   | Types disappear after compilation    |
| Compile Errors ≠ Runtime Errors | Compilation happens before execution |


TypeScript only adds compile-time support, not runtime behavior.
It is not executed, not interpreted, not loaded by browsers.
